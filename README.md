Repository for the source code used to produce the results in the paper **Predicting Treatment Response in Major Depressive Disorder using Structural MRI: A NeuroPharm Study**.

The purpose of the relevant files is as follow:
- demographics.R -  produces the demographics & clinical variables table
- asymmetry.R -  assesses the differences in brain asymmetry between responders and non-responders 
- regional_analysis.R - performs the comparison of regional cortical thickness and volume between responders and non-responders
- classification.py - performs the classification and provides relevant results and figures

The remaining files are used internally.

*To be added: code for the NAF-KO classification*
